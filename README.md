I was tasked by Horiseon to refactor the code of their website. The code is running as it should but could use some optimization. There are many redundant attributes that can be
simplified down to one feature. My job will be to condense any redundant features as well as make the code more readable for my employer without changing how the site looks or 
works. By the end of this project we should have a well optimized and fully ready webpage to represent Horiseon Search Optimization.
